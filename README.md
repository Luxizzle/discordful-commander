# Discordful-Commander

Commander is a command module for discordful

# How to use

Commander is fairly easy to use, my goal was to make it simple without leaving anything advanced out.

To start with Commander you need to create a new Commander instance
```js
var Commander = require('discordful-commander');
var cmder = new Commander({
  prefix: '/',
  selfbot: false
})
```
You can give the Commander constructor a few options, some of the important ones are `prefix` and `selfbot`.

- `selfbot` makes it so the parser doesnt respond to other users but the connected user itself.
- `prefix` is the prefix of the bot to activate commands.

To create a new commander simple call `cmder.command`

```js
cmder
  .command('ping', { // Register new a command
    desc: 'Pings the bot' // Description of the command
  })
  .callback(function(msg, arg1, arg2, arg3) { // This adds a callback to the command when its activated
  // First argument is the message object generated by Commander itself.
    // This has a few neat properties such as msg.date which is parsed by chrono
  // the arguments are special objects, you can get their values with arg.value
    // to get more information on these check out src/MessageInterfaces/...
    this.reply('Pong!') // The enviroment allows you to call reply or send to send a message
  });

bot.event('MESSAGE_CREATE')
```
